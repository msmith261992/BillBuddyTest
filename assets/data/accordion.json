        "content": "Absolutely - you're never tied to one supplier, even if you're in a contract with them. If you've not switched your energy supplier in the past 12 months, the chances are that you've significantly overpaying. Even if you have switched recently, it's worth checking to see if you could save even more by switching to a better deal early."
